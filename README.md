## Authentication using Node.js, Fastify, MongoDb and bcrypt.js

I'm looking to build out a personal finance tracking platform for myself. The stack will be this authentication API connected to MongoDB, alongside a Next.js frontend.

I'm doing this project to expand on the fundamentals of Node.js, alongside the fact I'm not too fond of all personal finance tracking apps and still use Excel to this day.
